npAssetsOptimizerPlugin
=======================

**This plugin is in early pre-alpha state, documentation is totally incomplete and refactoring is in progress. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.**

This plugin provides a task to optimize web assets used in your project, typically for better frontend performances:

 * CSS files will be combined and compressed with [cssmin](http://code.google.com/p/cssmin/)
 * Javascript files will be combined and compressed with [JSMin](http://github.com/rgrove/jsmin-php/)
 * PNG web images will be optimized with [pngout](http://www.jonof.id.au/pngout) if avaible on the system

Of course, the optimizations made and their use is configurable by environments, so you can enable the call for optimized assets only in `prod` for example. Each optimization process can also be disabled. See the **Basic configuration** section of this document to find out how to do so.

Everything is done by configuring some YAML by default, but the plugin architecture allows to easily extend the service and optimizers as well. See the **Advanced configuration** section of this document to find out how to do so.

Installation

Basic configuration
-------------------

Basic configuration of assets optimization is done in a classic `app.yml` configuration file. The plugin ships with a default one you'll find in the `config` folder of the plugin directory.

Usage
-----

Tasks are available under the `optimize` namespace:

    $ php symfony list optimize

The `type` option allows to set the type of assets to optimize:

    $ php symfony optimize:assets --type=stylesheet
    $ php symfony optimize:assets --type=javascript
    $ php symfony optimize:assets --type=png_images

To optimize all assets in one call:

    $ php symfony optimize:assets --type=all
